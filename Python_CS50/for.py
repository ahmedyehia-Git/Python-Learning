for i in range(3): # same as for i in [0,1,2], so range is more easy for large number of loop
    print(i)

for x in range(10):
    print("hello")

for z in range(5,50,5): # first number is the starting pint (defult is 0), 2nd number is the number of loop, 3rd is the increase value (defult is 1)
    print(z)
